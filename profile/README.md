# fox32

**fox32** (stylized in all lowercase) is a 32 bit fantasy computer architecture, with a custom operating system and user interface inspired by various classic computers.

## Getting Started

**Note: This software is still very much in an early stage, and is currently more focused towards developers rather than end-users.**

The full **fox32** suite mainly consists of 4 components, each seperated into their own repository. See their README files for more info:
 - [fox32](https://github.com/fox32-arch/fox32) - the virtual machine itself
 - [fox32asm](https://github.com/fox32-arch/fox32asm) - the fox32 assembler
 - [fox32rom](https://github.com/fox32-arch/fox32rom) - a collection of commonly-used routines
 - [fox32os](https://github.com/fox32-arch/fox32os) (planned) - a multitasking operating system with a simple windowing system

Documentation is a work-in-progress.
